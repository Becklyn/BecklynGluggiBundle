<h1 class="h1">Content</h1>

<p>
    This example shows a lot of different cases of content that you can enter in the rich text editor. All example
    texts are excerpts from the book <strong>Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde</strong> from Robert Louis Stevenson.
    All sections that separate the different test cases are separated by a small headline using the üìö emoji.

    This is an example text with <strong>strong emphasized text</strong> (using &lt;strong&gt;) and <b>strong emphasized text</b> (using &lt;b&gt;).
    There is also <em>weak emphasized text</em> (using &lt;em&gt;) and <i>weak emphasized text</i> (using &lt;i&gt;).
    There is also <u>underlined text</u>.
    There can be <code>inline code</code>.
    Sometimes there is also a <a href="https://mayd.io">Link</a> and a link to open in a new tab <a href="https://mayd.io" target="_blank"></a>.<br>
    That was a line break.<br>
    Another one.
